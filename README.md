# Blender Art Gallery 
This is a Art gallery website of a collections of things I have created in blender last year.

A collection of renders made using the 3d software called blender.


# Free to use
I would appreciate feedback on what steps can be taken to improve on this version.
 
 #
 Learned how to create a carousel in javascript and utilize local storage effectively to store values then import them on to a new page. 
 I see the process similar to react's imports or template languages like ejs. 
 
 # Installation 
 * Download the zip file 
 * Extract files 
 * Upload to your choosen IDE
 * There are no extra files to download
 * Enjoy
 
 # How it works 
 Simply click on explore or gallery and you'll be transported to a gallery of renders. If you like the image you can save for later or add a like list. This will save the photo name in local storage.
 The name will appear in the save for later section along with the image. You can then comment on each image onece you input your message in the input box then click on the checkbox on which image you want to comment to be assigned to.
 This will store your comment underneath the image title.
 
 # Known Errors
 * Main explore button is not correctly positioned 
 * Refactor code
 * Navbar on save for later is not correctly positioned
